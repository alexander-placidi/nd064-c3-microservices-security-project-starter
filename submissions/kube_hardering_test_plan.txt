## How will you test the changes?
At first I'll apply the hardening steps on a non-production environment. 
Ideally its setup should be identical to the production-environment. Depending on the specific harding steps that have been carried out, the cluster need to be provisioned again. 
Then I'll verify the changes by running kube-bench once again. Now the tests should pass particularily for the issues we have addressed during the hardening steps. 
As a best practice we can implement regular checks with CronJobs or schedulers to make sure that we notice changes on the cluster that are relevant from a security perspective. 


## How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster? 

The hardening steps will be carried out on the non-production system. 
We can monitor metrics using techniques such as Prometheus and Grafana. 
By reading the data we can see if the cluster is still fully operational.
These data could be:
- health of the nodes
- health of the pods
- check for events and logs that indicate errors

Only if the changes are effective and the cluster is still fully operational, the changes can be rolled out on the production systems.  
Sometimes problems due to particular hardening steps donâ€™t materialize of there is no load on the testing systems. 
To make sure that we notice such issues, we can use canary testing where we split some traffic from the production system to to test system.
