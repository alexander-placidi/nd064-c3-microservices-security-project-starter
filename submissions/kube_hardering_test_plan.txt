## How will you test the changes? 
At first I'll apply the hardening steps on a non-production environment. 
Ideally its setup should be identical to the production-environment. 
Then I'll test the changes on the non-production environment.

## How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster? 

The hardening steps will be carried out on the non-production system. 
We can monitor metrics using techniques such as Prometheus and Grafana. 
By reading the data we can if the cluster is still fully operational.
These data could be:
- health of the nodes
- health of the pods
- check for events and logs that indicate errors
