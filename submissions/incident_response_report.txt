1. Incident commander name: Alexander Placidi
2. Executive Summary of what happened: 
We found that an attacker created three pods in the default namespace.
These are
cryptotonight
minergate
moneropool
These pods are crypto-mining software. 

3. Summary of what was affected:
The attacker was able to get control of the cluster and inject workloads.
Usually attackers look for computing resources for running malicious workloads such as cryptomining. 
The attack affected the kubernetes cluster by using computing resources. 

4. Summary of the impact:
The cryptomining pods that were injected by the attacker consume a significant amount of computing resources.
Under certain circumstances this can cause the other workloads to starve or crash because of the lack of resources.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
The pods can be evicted by issueing the following command:
kubectl delete pod <pod_name> --grace-period=0 --force>

After evicting the pods, the administrator has to check the metrics in the Grafana dashboards in order to verify
that the usage of cpu and memory resources is within normal parameters again. 

6. Summary of lessons learned:
In order to prevent such attacks for the future, we should implement the following measures:
- use admission controller to allow only certain images to be imported and started within the pods
- use Grafana dashboards and alerts in order to get notified if unusual activity is happening
- use Falco and export kernel-level metrics to Grafana in order to get notified 
  if unusual activity is happening on the host machine
